GENERAL DEVELOPMENT NOTES:
=================================================

    * Project's sources accessible from a Mercurial version control repository
      hosted by BitBucket at 'https://bitbucket.org/jurko/suds'.

    * Project development should be tracked in the TODO.txt file.
        * Exact formatting is not important as long as its contect is kept
          formatted consistently.
        * Done tasks should be marked as such and not deleted.

    * Testing.
        * 'pytest' testing framework needed to run unit tests.
        * To run the tests using Python 3 first process them and the rest of the
          library sources using the Python 2to3 conversion tool.

    * Reproducing problematic use cases.
        * Failing web service processing examples can be easiliy packaged as
          reproducible test cases using the Suds library 'message & reply
          injection' technique.
        * For examples, see existing reply unit tests.
            * Basically, you can create a client object based on a fixed WSDL
              string (as done in the tests), and make it process a fixed reply
              string (as done in the tests) without having it send a request to
              an actual external web service.

    * Base sources should remain Python 2.x compatible. Since the original
      project states aiming for Python 2.4 compatibility we should do so as
      well.
        * Compatibility notes.
            * Features introduced in Python 2.5.
                * 'any' & 'all' functions.
                * 'with' statement.
                * 'try/except/finally' blocks.
                    * Prior to this Python release code like the following:
                        try:
                            A
                        except XXX:
                            B
                        finally:
                            C
                      is considered illegal and needed to be written using
                      nested try blocks as in:
                        try:
                            try:
                                A
                            except XXX:
                                B
                        finally:
                            C
            * Features introduced in Python 2.6.
                * 'bytes' type.
                * Byte literals, e.g. b"quack".
                * String format() method.
            * Features introduced in Python 2.7.
                * Dictionary & set comprehensions.
                * Set literals.

    * Handling Python 3 related patches applicable to the original suds
      development project.
        * Originally synchronized with the Mercurial patch queue hosted at
          'https://bitbucket.org/bernh/suds-python-3-patches'.
        * Used to be synchronized with the originating queue but that
          synchronization is no longer being maintained as it became more and
          more difficult as our work on suds progressed and both the original
          suds project and this patch queue seem dead otherwise.
            * Used to be committed first to the 'Python 3 support' branch and
              then merged back to the trunk from there.
