# Main project configuration.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Specific scripts using this configuration may support interpolating values
# from other options inside the same section using the '%(option)s' syntax. The
# same syntax may also be used to interpolate additional values provided by the
# calling script instead of being read from the configuration file itself, e.g.
# value '%(__name__)s' always refers to the name of the current section.
#
# For example, if interpolation is enabled, configuration
#
#   [demo-section]
#   basic = Foo
#   derived = %(basic value)s-Bar
#
# generates the following options located in the section 'demo-section':
#
#   'basic' with the value 'Foo'
#   'derived' with the value 'Foo-Bar'
